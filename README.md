### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anne Dorko, a queer musical artist without any teams, funding, or management. 

- ðŸ”­ I'm working on a Strapi-based Source-of-Truth API to centralize my content creation and marketing resources for my music.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning JAMstack: Strapi, Gatsby, Next.js
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: They/Them
- âš¡ Fun fact: You can look me up on Spotify or wherever you listen to music to stream my originals and covers.
